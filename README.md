- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chadgalusha. I live in Tennessee and am employed as Application Support for Philips. I deal with access for SAP, Salesforce, and am developing
     an MVC web application for my team that displays information such as contact information, service names in ServiceNow, and who the Service Manager is for the
     various applications my company uses.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning all things software development! I want to continue learning and growing in my knowledge and abilities!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Application and Database Development in college (~graduation is Winter 2021). I am also continuing to learn C# and SQL primarily, but am
      also interested in Python and Java (really, I'll be happy to take on any language). On the side I am learning more about MVC and API projects within the dotnet
      environment, and various small projects to sharpen my skills.
