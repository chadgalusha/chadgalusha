- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chadgalusha. I live in Tennessee and am employed as Programmer/Developer for Capgemini.  My current project is focused on cloud resiliency for a POS system, which will ensure the store that uses the POS will have a continual connection to AWS resources. The primary langauge of this project is C#. We also use gherkin (SpecFlow) for behavior testing. AWS services such as API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB are utilized heavily. With Capgemini I have learned technologies such as AWS services and Node.js.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning all things software development! I want to continue learning and growing in my knowledge and abilities!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS services, behavior development with gherkin and SpecFlow, and NoSQL databases.
