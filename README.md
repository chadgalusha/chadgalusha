- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chadgalusha. I live in Tennessee and am employed as Programmer/Developer for Capgemini. My current project is application support for a quality control manufacturing system for various facilities. On this project I utilize tools such as Oracle SQL Developer, Windows Server, PowerShell and command-line utilities, WinSCP, PuTTY, and ServiceNow. I have been able to build database queries for various reports and to automate manual tasks (query, update, commit, etc.).

- Another project I was on focused on cloud resiliency for a POS system, which ensured the store that uses the POS will have a continual connection to AWS resources. The primary langauge of this project was C#. We also used gherkin (SpecFlow) for behavior testing and AWS services such as API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

- With Capgemini I have learned technologies such as AWS services and Node.js.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning all things software development! I want to continue learning and growing in my knowledge and abilities!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SignalR, Rest APIs, and front-end development with Blazor.
